S2 Stripe - Thin layer between S2 Member and Stripe.com payments

Intro
------

This is a plugin I made for Wordpress to integrate Stripe payments into Wordpress. It all started after a request from a client of mine, for his own personal website. He wanted to replace Paypal forms with Stripe payments, and as everyone knows, S2 isnt supporting this gateway yet (and my guess is that they wont in the near future). So we succesfully built a bspoke implementation and then I ported the whole code to a wordpress plugin, with a few improvements, shortcodes, etc.

At first, I was looking to sell this and make some $$ in return, but my full time work at SheologyDigital.com wont allow me to reply to support tickets in time. So here is the github repo for it, free for everyone.

Feel free to fork, extend, and make this better. Im going to check and accept pull requests (if any).
